### Ranks
I used to grind competitive games but now I learned myself to enjoy and have fun while playing casually. Right now I just chill arround and talk to my friends through discord.

### Library
I buy a lot of random games just to make my library diverse but honestly I only really play like 4 to 5 games. ofcourse the games are mostly free to play.down below I rank the games I played consistently for a couple months. A friendly reminder that the rankings are based on my own opinion.

* **Valorant** 
    - I've been grinding Valorant for a long time now, and it’s one of those games that I keep coming back to. As my first FPS (First-Person Shooter) experience, Valorant has been a thrilling ride, and the fact that it’s my first makes the journey even more special.

    - I started playing Valorant about a month after its official release, and I have to admit—it still feels just as fun as it did back then. The diversity in each match keeps the gameplay fresh, and no two matches feel exactly the same. The blend of strategic thinking, precise shooting, and teamwork makes every match an adventure.

     - However, as I’ve climbed higher in the ranks, the game has changed. At higher Elo, matches tend to revolve around the meta, which can make the experience feel more rigid and predictable. Instead of the dynamic, ever-changing matches I enjoyed when I first started, the higher levels of play can sometimes feel repetitive, as everyone is focused on the most effective strategies and agents.

    - Despite this, Valorant still manages to hold my attention. Even though the high Elo meta can be a bit monotonous, the core gameplay—filled with clutch moments, strategic plays, and the thrill of outsmarting your opponents—continues to make Valorant an exciting and engaging experience.

* **Team Fight Tactics**
    - Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is one of Riot Games' best creations. The game offers a unique blend of strategy and adaptability, making each match feel fresh. Riot's frequent updates and patches ensure the game is always evolving, keeping the meta dynamic and preventing it from getting stale.

    - The core mechanics, like buying champions and managing your economy, provide a solid strategic foundation. The balance between luck and skill keeps the gameplay exciting, rewarding players who can adapt and strategize effectively.

    - Overall, TFT stands out for its constantly evolving gameplay and the strategic depth it offers, making it one of Riot's top games.

* **Horizon Series(Zero Dawn to Forbidden West)**
    - Horizon: Zero Dawn instantly drew me in with its breathtaking world and unique premise. Exploring the post-apocalyptic landscapes as Aloy, uncovering secrets, and battling robotic beasts was an unforgettable experience. The game’s rich storytelling and dynamic combat made it a standout adventure.

    - When Horizon Forbidden West came out, it felt like a perfect continuation of that journey. The sequel took everything great about Zero Dawn and made it even better—more stunning environments, deeper lore, and refined gameplay. Exploring the new territories and facing new challenges kept me hooked from start to finish.

    - Both games offer a seamless experience, but each stands strong on its own. Horizon remains one of those series I’ll always return to, not just for its stunning visuals and engaging combat, but for the immersive adventure it delivers every time.

* **From CS to CS2**
    - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been a staple in my gaming lineup for years. The thrill of its competitive gameplay, the satisfaction of landing that perfect shot, and the deep strategic layers kept me hooked. Every match felt like a test of skill and strategy, and I loved every minute of it.

    - When CS2 was announced, I was excited about the updates and improvements it promised. But after spending time in the game, my excitement quickly turned to frustration. The biggest issue? Hackers. They’ve become rampant, ruining the competitive integrity that made CS so enjoyable. What was once a test of skill now feels like a battle against cheaters, and it’s taken a lot of the fun out of the game.

    - Despite my love for the Counter-Strike series, CS2 has been a major letdown. The presence of hackers has made it hard to enjoy what should have been an exciting evolution of the game. I find myself missing the days of CS, where the matches felt fair, and the competition was about skill, not who could exploit the game better.

* **Pokemon Series**
    - My Pokémon adventure began with the original games, Pokémon Red and Blue. The thrill of exploring Kanto, catching my first Pokémon, and striving to become the Champion was a childhood dream come true. From those early days, my love for the series only grew stronger.

    - Pokémon Emerald was a standout chapter in my journey. The vibrant Hoenn region, with its diverse environments and engaging storyline, offered an experience that felt both fresh and nostalgic. The quest to become the Pokémon Champion while discovering the secrets of the legendary Pokémon was a highlight.
 
    - As the series evolved, each new game added its own unique flair. Diamond and Pearl introduced the Sinnoh region with its intricate lore and new Pokémon, while Black and White brought arefreshing change with a focus on story and new creatures. X and Y’s leap into 3D was a game-changer, offering a new perspective on the Pokémon world.

    - The series continued to innovate with the introduction of new mechanics and regions. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet brought us to the Paldea region, with an open-world experience that felt like a natural evolution of the series. The open-world exploration, new Pokémon, and gameplay enhancements made it an exciting addition to the franchise.
 
    - Looking back, from the pixelated adventures of the original games to the expansive worlds of the latest titles, Pokémon has always delivered something special. Each game has added its own layer to the rich tapestry of the Pokémon universe, making every new release a fresh and exhilarating experience.
